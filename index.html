        <section id="s2"><p> Wings of Fire is my favourite book series, and in the sixth book, a dragonet called Kinkajou is introduced, where she is one of the friends to the protagonist of the book, Moonwatcher. She attends Jade Mountain Academy, where she shares her room with other dragonets, named Quibli, Moonwatcher, Turtle, Winter, Umber and Carnelian. She is friendly with everyone, even with hostile Winter, and can't stop her scales erupting into colors of yellow and pink. She is one of Queen Glory's friends, and will always defend her friends no matter what. She, like other Rainwing dragons, spits venom, and has been injured by it once, but the Seawing dragon Anemone healed her. She, unlike other Rainwings, is not lazy. She is always buzzing with activity.
